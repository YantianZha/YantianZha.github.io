Yantian is a PhD student working in the [Yochan](https://yochan-lab.github.io/home/){:target="_blank"} research group directed by [Prof. Subbarao Kambhampati](http://rakaposhi.eas.asu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, at [Arizona State University](http://www.asu.edu){:target="_blank"}. Prior to joining Yochan Lab in 2015, he worked with [Prof. Xudong Ma](https://automation.seu.edu.cn/2019/0528/c24505a275234/page.htm){:target="_blank"}, and [Dr. Kun Qian](https://automation.seu.edu.cn/2019/0528/c24504a275190/page.htm){:target="_blank"} in the Institute of Intelligent Robotics and Intelligent Control at Southeast University. 

Yantian is interested in planning, vision, and their integrations that improve the cognitive abilities of robots. 

Yantian is also an amateur pianist who received his [Level 10 Piano Certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzFSKJBTOGjKRExJZENGajlCVG8/view){:target="_blank"} when he was a boy.
