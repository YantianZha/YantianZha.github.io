Yantian was born in Nanjing, China. While Yantian started learning piano at three years old (and eventually obtained his [10-Level Piano Certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzFSKJBTOGjKRExJZENGajlCVG8/view){:target="_blank"}), Yantian is committed to Robotics (which is one of Yantian's childhood dreams). Yantian's robotics journey truly set out when he was an undergrad, working with [Prof. Xudong Ma](https://automation.seu.edu.cn/2019/0528/c24505a275234/page.htm){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Kun Qian](https://automation.seu.edu.cn/2019/0528/c24504a275190/page.htm){:target="_blank"} at the Institute of Intelligent Robotics and Intelligent Control, Southeast University. After that, Yantian went to Arizona State University and had a delighted Ph.D. life with his advisor [Prof. Subbarao Kambhampati (Rao)](http://rakaposhi.eas.asu.edu/){:target="_blank"} (as clearly seen from the title of Yantian's [Ph.D. Thesis](https://yantianzha.github.io/yantianthesis.github.io/){:target="_blank"}). Recently, Yantian becomes a Postdoctoral Associate, working with [Prof. Yiannis Aloimonos](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~yiannis/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Cornelia Ferm√ºller](https://isr.umd.edu/clark/faculty/1168/Cornelia-Ferm%C3%BCller){:target="_blank"} in the [Perception & Robotics Group](http://prg.cs.umd.edu/){:target="_blank"}, at the University of Maryland, College Park.

Research Interest:

Yantian is interested in Cognitive Robot Learning -- how different levels of cognitive functions like perception, acting, planning, and metacognition, can be tightly coupled to achieve human-level intelligence for robots.

Teaching:
