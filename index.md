I am a PhD student majoring in Computer Science at [Arizona State University](http://www.asu.edu){:target="_blank"}. I am a member of [Yochan](https://yochan-lab.github.io/home/){:target="_blank"} research group directed by [Prof. Subbarao Kambhampati](http://rakaposhi.eas.asu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Before joining ASU in 2015, I did my Master's at [University of Southern California](http://www.usc.edu){:target="_blank"} with a major in Computer Science. At USC, I worked on multi-agent path planning problems at [IDM Lab](http://idm-lab.org){:target="_blank"} while being supervised by [Dr. T. K. Satish Kumar](https://www.tkskwork.org/){:target="_blank"} and on human-robot interaction related projects at [Interaction Lab](http://robotics.usc.edu/interaction/){:target="_blank"}.

If you'd like to contact me, please drop me a mail at [anaghak at asu dot edu](mailto:anaghak@asu.edu) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anaghapk){:target="_blank"}.
